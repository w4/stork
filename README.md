`stork` is a simple futures-based library to recursively crawl
sources in a search engine-like fashion. stork was designed from the
ground to have a simple API that is easy to use and can be reused
across multiple protocols, yielding each result giving end users the
freedom to do BFS, DFS or any type of search they may so wish.
