`stork` is a simple futures-based library to recursively crawl
sources in a search engine-like fashion. stork was designed from the
ground to have a simple API that is easy to use and can be reused
across multiple protocols, yielding each result giving end users the
freedom to do BFS, DFS or any type of search they may so wish.

**The API is extremely unstable currently and will likely go through quite a few revisions before we get it stable, I'll keep on top of the changelogs but please keep this in mind when using the library.**
